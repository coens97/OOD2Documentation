\chapter{Decisions and Rules}
\section{Algorithm chosen}
\label{sec:algch}	
We choose to use the mathematical way to calculate the flows. The reason is that it is easier for us to do the calculation and programming, though in the reality, the way the system works may seem bizarre. For example when an output is not connected to a splitter the flow is mathematically divided.

\section{Default values}
\label{sec:defv}
We set the default numbers of pipes and pumps to 0, and the default value of each splitter to 50/50. However, the value of each splitter is adjustable. With these default settings, our system has a clearer starting point since relative information is not mentioned in the requirement. Since an normal splitter can also be achieved with an adjustable splitter it is easier to remove the normal splitter to prevent confusion.

\section{Removing features}
\label{sec:rem}
To gain more time we removed some nice features but with still keeping the core goal of the application in mind.
